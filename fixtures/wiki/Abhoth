'''Abhoth'''<ref>'''Original Source:''' {{w|Clark Ashton Smith}}, "The Seven Geases", 1934; {{Cite book/In Search of Sanity|64}}</ref> is the [[Outer God]] of [[disease]], fecundity, and [[ooze]]s.<ref name="PF109-64">{{Cite book/In Search of Sanity|64}}</ref>

==Appearance==

Abhoth appears as a massive ooze whose eyes, mouths, organs, and pseudopods constantly form and are consumed.<ref name="PF109-64"/>

==Realm==

Abhoth dwells in a grotto connected to the deepest forgotten or undiscovered underground caverns of many [[planet]]s.<ref name="PF109-64"/>

==Servants==

Oozes constantly form and slough off from Abhoth's bulk. Abhoth's pseudopods grasp many offspring and reabsorb them into its mass, but some manage to escape and find [[portal]]s from Abhoth's lair to the caverns in other worlds. These spawn can spawn races of their own, and through them Abhoth can see, explore, and infect any world they touch.<ref name="PF109-64"/>

==Worshipers and clergy==

According to Abhoth's cultists, all life in the [[Material Plane]] is descended from it.<ref name="PF109-64"/>

==On Golarion==
Cerain remote tunnels in the [[Darklands]] connect to the cavern where Abhoth dwells. One such tunnel is located in the [[Midnight Mountains]] in [[Orv]], where the [[Primal Mouth]], one of Abhoth's most powerful spawn, resides with its [[gug]] minions.<ref>{{Cite book/Black Stars Beckon|68}}</ref>
