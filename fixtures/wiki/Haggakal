'''Haggakal''' is an [[ogre]] [[god]], the offspring of an [[evil]] deity and a [[giant]]. His followers believe him to be a round ogre face in the sky (the [[moon]]). For them, the waning moon is the time to hunt and to raid while the waxing moon symbolizes the time of their god's return. Other myths interpret the moon's phases as the incestuous relationship Haggakal has with his twin sister and the resulting pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|49-50}}</ref>

== Church of Haggakal ==
Few ogres are smart enough to worship Haggakal, but those who do create simple myths highlighting his strength and virility.<ref>{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|188}}</ref>
