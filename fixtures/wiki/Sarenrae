Known to her faithful as the Dawnflower, the Healing Flame, and the Everlight, '''Sarenrae''' (pronounced SAER-en-ray<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|247}}</ref>) is a [[goddess]] who teaches temperance and patience in all things. Compassion and peace are her greatest virtues, and if enemies of the faith can be redeemed, they should be.<ref name="Blog73007"/>

== Dogma ==

[[File:Prismatic Ray.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sarenrae (foreground) relaxes with [[Shelyn]] and [[Desna]].]]

Yet there are those who have no interest in redemption, who glory in slaughter and death. From the remorseless [[evil]] of the [[undead]] and [[fiend]]s, to the cruelties born in the hearts of mortals, Sarenrae's doctrines preach swift justice delivered by the [[scimitar|scimitar's]] edge. To this end, she expects her faithful to be skilled at swordplay, both as a form of martial art promoting centering of mind and body, and so that when they do enter battle, their foes do not suffer any longer than necessary.<ref name="Blog73007">{{Cite web|date=July 30, 2007|author=[[James Jacobs]]|title=Meet the Iconics: Kyra|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5la5u|page=Paizo Blog}}</ref>

== History ==

According to the teachings of the followers of [[Asmodeus]] (whose motives should always be questioned), Sarenrae is one of the oldest gods in existence, having been created by [[Ihys]], one of the two primordial deities in the time before time. She comforted Ihys when his brother Asmodeus castigated him for giving free will to mortals. Sarenrae served as Ihys's right hand in the first war between the gods, when the gods of chaos (led by Ihys) clashed with the gods of law (led by Asmodeus). In a rage, Sarenrae confronted Asmodeus when the Prince of Darkness slew Ihys and was nearly killed, but Asmodeus realized that he could never quench her resolution and that his battle was hopeless. He then abandoned the war and retreated to [[Hell]].<ref>{{Cite book/Princes of Darkness|62-63}}</ref> According to the ''[[Windsong Testaments]]'', Sarenrae was one of the first eight deities of this incarnation of the [[Great Beyond|multiverse]]. She marvelled at the [[star]]s created by [[Desna]], and chose some of them to give life so creation could begin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: The Three Fears of Pharasma|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=October 31, 2019|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgzu}}</ref>

Near the end of the [[Age of Creation]], when [[Rovagug]] descended upon the [[Material Plane]] to wreak havoc, Sarenrae took note and called upon an alliance of gods to oppose him. During this magnificent war of prehistory, the Dawnflower cast down Rovagug to the [[Dead Vault]] at the center of [[Golarion]]. It is believed that after Asmodeus bound the Rough Beast there, Sarenrae placed therein the raging flames of the [[sun]] as an eternal torment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Windsong Testaments: Rage of Creation|page=Paizo Blog|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=January 2, 2020|url=https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh26}}</ref><ref name="GM-32">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|32}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|212}}</ref> Sarenrae repaired the gash in the earth and commanded her followers to avoid the smooth scar that remained.<ref name="MR-28"/>

During the [[Age of Anguish]], her faithful living in nearby [[Ninshabur]] misinterpreted her instructions, however, and instead flocked to the area, eventually founding the settlement of [[Gormuz]] there. Believing Gormuz to be a holy city of Sarenrae, people from all over [[Casmaron]] flocked there for millennia, but were slowly corrupted by the imprisoned god Rovagug's dreams. Sarenrae continued sending portents and visions to her faithful in Gormuz during this period, but they were ignored or misinterpreted. She finally sent her [[herald]] [[Kohal]] to the people of Gormuz in [[-3923 AR]], but they had been so corrupted that they destroyed him instead. In great wrath, Sarenrae was tricked by Rovagug into smiting Gormuz with her scimitar, destroying it completely, and created an enormous rent in the earth that eventually became known as the [[Pit of Gormuz]]. Upon seeing that her mistake has excavated Rovagug's prison and allowed all kinds of monsters, including [[Ulunat]], the first [[Spawn of Rovagug]], to disgorge themselves on Golarion's surface, Sarenrae learnt a valuable lesson in espousing redemption over wrath.<ref name="MR-28">{{Cite book/Mythic Realms|28}}</ref>

==Home==
Sarenrae's realm of [[Everlight]] appears as a sun hanging at high noon in the sky of [[Nirvana]]. Her servitors gather there to plan their crusades without fear of espionage, as those who seek do do [[evil]] are banned from the realm. Sarenrae occasionally takes [[human]] form to walk the streets of [[High Ninshabur]], learning from the less fortunate and reminding herself of her responsibility to care for the [[Great Beyond]].<ref name="PA-164">{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|164}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|165}}</ref>

== Appearance ==
[[File:Sarenrae.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A common depiction of the Dawnflower.]]
Sarenrae manifests as a bronze angelic beauty with golden hair composed of flowing flame. She emits a holy light which trickles down like liquid luminescence from one hand, while the other holds a scimitar emblazoned with radiant fire. Her holy light provides healing and sustenance, while the scimitar creates gusts of winds that remove disease and fear.<ref name="GM-34"/>

== Relationships ==

Sarenrae counts all non-evil gods as her companions, and even communicates with evil deities in the hopes of converting them from their dark ways, although certain tradition-bound deities like [[Torag]] distrust the Dawnflower and her flock, seeing their willingness to forgive is a weakness.<ref name="ISWG-226">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|226}}</ref><ref name="PA-163">{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|163}}</ref>

While Sarenrae believes in redemption, she understands that certain beings are irredeemable, including her only true enemy Rovagug and ironically Asmodeus, who once worked with her to imprison Rovagug. Sarenrae's hope that their cooperation would lead him to redemption never came to pass, and now she regards Asmodeus in the same category as Rovagug. Their rivalry goes much farther than their constant battle over [[soul]]s.<ref name="GM-34">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|34-35}}</ref><ref name="CS-167">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|167}}</ref><ref name="PA-163"/>

== Providence ==

Sarenrae shows her approval by sending [[dove]]s, or the unusual appearance of ankhs. She indicates her disfavor through unexplained sunburns or blindness that can last from minutes for minor transgressions to an entire lifetime for the worst offenses.<ref name="ISWG-225"/>

== Servants ==

Sarenrae has numerous [[angel]]ic servants. Among these are her [[divine servitor]]s, the [[yhohm]], who are said to be born from a portion of [[phoenix|phoenixes']] [[soul]]s every time they are reborn in fire.<ref name="ISG-307">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|307}}</ref>

=== Unique servants ===

; [[Bryla]]: This servant of Sarenrae is manifested as a wheel of flaming sunlight.<ref name="GM-34"/>

; [[Charlabu]]: Charlabu is a gold-colored [[hound archon]] that often appears in a canine form.<ref name="GM-34"/>

; [[Mystmorning]]: This servant of the Dawnflower is an intelligent animated blade and possesses the same powers as that of a [[celestial]] [[unicorn]].<ref name="GM-34"/>

; [[Sunlord Thalachos]]: Her [[herald]] is a platinum-skinned angelic minion that is escorted by 11 divine doves.<ref name="GM-34"/>

== Church of Sarenrae ==

[[File:Pathfinder 3 Scalera virgin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kyra]], a [[cleric]] of Sarenrae.]]
The church of Sarenrae is mostly composed of altruistic priests who are also ready to be stern should it be warranted. The church is known for blessing crops, healing the sick, and reforming criminals and evil doers. They are often consulted to solve feuds and disputes among neighbors and families.<ref name="GM-34"/> The [[Empire of Kelesh]] holds her as their patron deity and is responsible for spreading her faith throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="CS-153">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|153}}</ref> Here she is worshiped primarily in [[Absalom]], [[Katapesh]], [[Osirion]], [[Taldor]], [[Thuvia]], and of course [[Qadira]],<ref name="ISWG-225">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|225}}</ref> and among [[Garundi (human ethnicity)|Garundi]],<ref name="ISWG-">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|}}</ref> [[Keleshite (human ethnicity)|Keleshites]],<ref name="ISWG-15">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|15}}</ref> [[Taldan]]s,<ref name="ISWG-19">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|19}}</ref> [[Varisian]]s,<ref name="ISWG-22">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|22}}</ref> [[halfling]]s,<ref name="ISWG-27">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|27}}</ref> and [[half-elf|half-elves]] throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="ISWG-28">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|28}}</ref>

The [[Cult of the Dawnflower]] is a militant sect of the church that is popular and influential in Osirion and Qadira.<ref>{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|147, 151}}</ref>

Kind and caring halflings often worship Sarenrae, tending to the sick and elderly. Rarely, a halfling may be born with red hair and, as this is seen by halflings as a sign from the goddess, these halflings are expected to become part of Sarenrae's clergy.<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|17}}</ref> Sarenrae is also one of the most popular deities worshipped by the strange planar race known as [[Duskwalker|duskwalkers]].<ref name="PA-230-231">{{Cite book/Planar Adventures|230-231}}</ref>

[[Knight]]s of Sarenrae identify themselves by wearing white scarves around their helms and wielding the scimitar. They are willing to offer mercy to those enemies who seek absolution and renounce evil.<ref>{{Cite book/Knights of the Inner Sea|18}}</ref>

=== Clergy ===

{{See also|Dawnflower dissident}}

A large portion of Sarenrae's priests are composed of [[cleric]]s, but within their ranks are also [[paladin|paladins]] and [[ranger|rangers]], as well as a few [[druid]]s and [[bard|bards]]. Some priests work as personal retainers or healers for the wealthy, while others survive on assistance from congregational worshipers. A common form of worship by priests is to awaken with the dawn and give thanks and praise to the rising sun. The scimitar is a favored weapon and its use is held in high regard,<ref name="GM-34"/> and it is often decorated with sunburst images in red and gold.<ref name="ISWG-225"/> In battle, Sarenrae's clerics become dervishes, ready to destroy irredeemable corruption.<ref name="CS-167">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|167}}</ref> Formal raiments include a long white chasuble and tunic with red and gold decorations depicting the sun. Worship leaders often wear a golden crown topped by a red-gold sunburst.<ref name="ISWG-225"/>

=== Temples and shrines ===

The main temples of the Dawnflower are open-air buildings, although side buildings have ceilings. Many have brass or gold mirrors that refocus the sunlight on the main altar.<ref name="ISWG-225"/> Priests often travel from one temple to the next. The [[Everlight Oasis|Everlight Oasis]] in Kelesh is a popular site of pilgrimage for followers of the goddess.<ref name="CS-153">{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|153}}</ref> Church services are held outdoors and are joyous affairs that feature singing, dancing, and music.<ref name="GM-34"/>

=== Holy texts ===

''[[The Birth of Light and Truth]]'' is the principal holy book of Sarenrae.<ref name="GM-34"/> It is customary for every owner of this book to inscribe her own uplifting stories in the last few blank pages, so that they can be recounted to others later.<ref name="ISWG-225"/>

=== Church history ===

The peoples of the Inner Sea region did not always worship Sarenrae. Her faith spread along the Keleshite trade routes during the early years of the [[Age of Enthronement]], touching off much instability in Garund.<ref name="ISWG-205">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|205}}</ref>

=== Holidays ===

The most commonly celebrated [[Holidays and festivals|holidays]] celebrated by the followers of Sarenrae are [[Burning Blades]] on the 10th of [[Sarenith]], and the [[Sunwrought Festival]], held on the [[Holidays and festivals#Summer Solstice|summer solstice]].<ref >{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|238}}</ref> The month of Sarenith is named in her honor.<ref name="ISWG-248">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|248}}</ref>

=== Dawnflower anchorites ===

{{Main|Dawnflower anchorite}}

The Dawnflower anchorite travels throughout the wilderness, fighting [[evil]] and offering redemption, while devoting herself to the greatest of [[Sarenrae|Sarenrae's]] blessings: the sun.<ref name="PotR-12-13">{{Cite book/Paths of the Righteous|12-13}}</ref>

Anchorites focus their studies on a personal credence through which they develop and express their faith, whether it takes the form of generating magical light or flaming [[weapon]]s.<ref name="PotR-12-13"/>

=== Favored animals ===

Gods are often associated with certain [[animal]]s, either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Sarenrae's favored animals include the [[dove]], the [[falcon]], and [[lizard|basking lizards]].<ref name="AA-ibc">{{Cite book/Animal Archive|inside back cover}}</ref>

== Organizations ==

The [[Dawn Vigil]] is a small band of Sarenite paladins who guard the Katapeshi town of [[Solku]] from [[gnoll]] attacks.<ref name="ISWG-93">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|93}}</ref>
