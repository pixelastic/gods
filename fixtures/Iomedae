'''Iomedae''' (pronounced ahy-OH-meh-day)<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|246}}</ref> is the [[goddess]] of righteous valor, justice, and honor. Having served as [[Aroden|Aroden's]] herald, she inherited many of the [[Aroden|Last Azlanti's]] followers upon his death, and continues to espouse the ideas of honor and righteousness in the defense of [[good]] and the battle against [[evil]].<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Parnoneryx and Iomedae.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Iomedae fights alongside the [[gold dragon]] [[Parnoneryx]] before her [[ascension]].]]

As a mortal, Iomedae was a [[Chelaxian (human ethnicity)|Chelaxian]] [[human]] born in [[Cheliax]] around [[3800 AR]].<ref name="HC69">{{Cite book/The Hellfire Compact|69}}</ref> After joining the [[Shining Crusade]] in about [[3816 AR]], she ascended to lead the [[Knights of Ozem]] in the struggle against the forces of the [[Whispering Tyrant]].<ref name="HC69"/> Years of struggle brought about many great feats, including the creation of the [[artifact]] ''[[Heart's Edge]]'' in [[3826 AR]] from the pieces of Iomedae's [[sword]] that had been broken by the [[Whispering Tyrant]], an action immortalized as [[Iomedae's Sixth Act]].<ref name="HC69"/> Also in this time, in [[3831 AR]], Iomedae completed her [[Iomedae's Tenth Act|Tenth Act]] after ruling [[Kantaria]] for a year and a day and battling [[faceless stalker]]s under the control of [[veiled master]]s.<ref name="HC69"/>

In the fall of [[3832 AR]],<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|239}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|202}}</ref> she became the most recent person to pass the [[Test of the Starstone|Test of the ''Starstone'']] and acquire a spark of divinity. Her actions caught the notice of Aroden, who chose her as his [[herald]], replacing the slain [[Arazni]]. Iomedae served him in this capacity until Aroden's death in [[4606 AR]],<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|202-203}}</ref> after which she took over many of his followers and legacy, and became known as the '''Inheritor'''.<ref name="ISWG-222">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|222}}</ref> Aroden was inspired by Iomedae's devotion, optimism, tenacity in the fight against evil and, especially, her goodness which was a foil to his own dark thoughts that grew as the millennia passed by.<ref>{{Cite book/A Song of Silver|73}}</ref>

== Relationships ==

Iomedae views [[Abadar]], [[Cayden Cailean]], [[Erastil]], [[Sarenrae]], [[Shelyn]], and [[Torag]] as allies. She harbours a grudge against [[Pharasma]] for keeping the truth behind Aroden's death a secret. There is also a slight rivalry between Iomedae and [[Irori]] and their respective followers. Irori's worshipers, believing that anyone can achieve divinity through rigorous discipline and self-improvement, consider achieving godhood via a magical artifact as cheating.<ref name="ISWG-222"/> With the exception of [[Asmodeus]], Iomedae never associates or parleys with evil gods or [[fiend]]s.<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref> She treats the Lord of [[Hell]] with extreme caution, and never in more than an advisory role.<ref>{{Cite book/Mother of Flies|67}}</ref>

== Appearance ==

[[File:Iomedae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An artist's rendition of Iomedae.]]

Iomedae manifests as a valiant sword-mistress in full [[plate mail]], wielding a [[longsword]] and a heraldic [[shield]]. Her shield casts a holy light, blinding evil beings, and her aura causes malevolent forces to tremble and falter.<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>

== Realm ==

Unlike Aroden's realm on [[Axis]], [[Iomedae's Realm]] is located on [[Proelera]], [[Heaven|Heaven's]] second tier. Even though she is a young [[deity]], she has been judged of great importance to Heaven, a fact reflected in the expansiveness of her realm. It is a peaceful land of small keeps that somewhat resembles the previous realm of Aroden, and is a significant source of support for Heaven's [[archon]] armies.<ref name="HU-7">{{Cite book/Heaven Unleashed|7}}</ref>

== Providence ==

Iomedae makes her favor known by reshaping ordinary objects into sword-like shapes, the appearance of gold or white light around a person or object, or the magnet-like pull of a longsword or other long metal [[weapon]] in a particular direction. Her anger is displayed through flickering lights, the breaking of weapons against formerly yielding material, and the tarnishing and increased weight of [[gold]] or [[silver]].<ref name="ISWG-222"/>

== Servants ==

Iomedae's [[divine servitor|divine servitor]] race are the [[angel]]s known as [[iophanite]]s. These flying, metal wheels resemble [[harbinger]]s or [[lantern archon]]s and aid the goddess and her forces in battle as messengers.<ref name="ISG-293">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|293}}</ref>

=== Unique servants ===

Iomedae's servants include a number of former mortals who have been given divine power following death.<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>  

; [[Hand of the Inheritor]]
: The [[herald]] of Iomedae appears as a golden-skinned [[angel]] who embraces honorable combat and the encouragement of just rulers, and the promotion of valorous deeds.<ref name="ISG-83">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|83}}</ref>

; [[Jingh]] 
: This servant of Iomedae manifests as a wheel of bright white metal illuminated by holy fire.<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>

; [[Peace Through Vigilance]]
: This servant is a young but cheerful and spirited [[celestial]] [[gold dragon]].<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>

; [[Lymirin|Saint Lymirin]]
: This former priestess of Iomedae sometimes appears as an [[eagle|eagle-headed]] winged [[humanoid]].<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref>

== Church of Iomedae ==

[[File:Iomedae ascendant.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Iomedae ascends to [[god]]hood after passing the [[Test of the Starstone]].]]
The Church of Iomedae is assertive and vigilant in rooting out evil. Many of its followers are actively involved in the [[Mendevian Crusades]].<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|164}}</ref> In fact, the threat of the [[Worldwound]] gave the church a purpose&mdash;finish the task [[Aroden]] started years ago and finally defeat [[Deskari]], the [[demon lord]] believed to be behind the opening of the portal to the [[Abyss]]. The church founded the [[First Mendevian Crusade]] in [[4622 AR]] as a way to lessen the loss of [[Aroden]], becoming zealots.<ref name="ISWG-118">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|199}}</ref> Besides [[Mendev]], Iomedae's faithful are also found in greater numbers in [[Absalom]], [[Andoran]], [[Cheliax]], [[Galt]], [[Lastwall]], [[Molthune]], [[Nirmathas]], [[Numeria]], and [[Sargava]],<ref name="ISWG-222"/><ref name="ISWG-142">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|142}}</ref> and among [[Chelaxian (human ethnicity)|Chelaxians]],<ref name="ISWG-13">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|13}}</ref> [[Taldan]]s,<ref name="ISWG-19">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|19}}</ref> and [[halfling]]s throughout the [[Inner Sea region]].<ref name="ISWG-27">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|27}}</ref>

Having inherited many of Aroden's faithful, Iomedae and her priests continue to promote his teachings, although they tend to be more progressive in their thinking than he ever was, and feel themselves less inhibited by the events of history.<ref name="ISWG-222"/>

=== Worshipers ===

[[File:Lastwall soldiers.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Followers of Iomedae in Lastwall prepare to defend themselves.]]
Personal cleanliness as well as an honorable demeanor are both very important for her followers,<ref name="GM-20"/> who are known for their sense of justice, swordcraft, statesmanship, and their desire to bring "civilization" to those "without it". [[Adventurer]]s who honor Iomedae sometimes wear a narrow white, red, yellow, or gold chasuble.<ref name="ISWG-222"/>

Many [[halfling]]s are treated unjustly on Golarion, or are kept as [[slavery|slaves]]. Nevertheless, some of these oppressed halflings believe in justice and often worship Iomedae,<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|17}}</ref> and most halfling [[paladin]]s serve the Inheritor.<ref>{{Cite book/Halflings of Golarion|20}}</ref>

Young [[knight]]s who are inspired by classical, courtly tales tend to follow Iomedae. They can be counted on to remain idealistic, even in the face of great evil. Their honor and faith are strong enough to overcome the vices and sins of their enemies.<ref>{{Cite book/Knights of the Inner Sea|18}}</ref> Iomedae's [[paladin]]s are also among the most prominent and well-represented in the Inner Sea region.<ref name="ISWG-275">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|275}}</ref>

==== Obedience ====

[[File:Holy warrior's gear.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The gear of an Iomedaean holy warrior.]]

Certain dedicated worshipers of Iomedae perform daily [[obedience]]s in order to receive a [[divine magic|divine]] blessing known as a [[boon]]s from their god. Iomedae's obedience takes the form of a ritual in which the worshiper holds his primary weapon in front of him with the goddess' [[holy symbol]] attached. He then prays for guidance and protection from the Inheritor, while promising to follow her teachings. When performed correctly, the ceremony is said to instill preternatural skills in diplomacy and knowledge of all things pertaining to the noble classes.<ref name="ISG-76">{{cite book/Inner Sea Gods|76}}</ref>

=== Clergy ===

Her priests are composed of [[cleric]]s and paladins, who perform an hour of prayer a day, in addition to a weekly public worship service.<ref name="GM-20">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|20}}</ref> Their formal raiment includes a white cassock with gold or yellow trim and mitre, while on non-festival days they dress in similarly colored, if less ostentatious, clothing.<ref name="ISWG-222"/>

=== Temples and shrines ===

The temples of Iomedae function as both a church and living space for her holy knights. Former temples of Aroden are frequently converted into honoring the Inheritor. Temples are often painted white and feature arched entrances, pillared courtyards, fountains, and statues.<ref name="GM-21">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|21}}</ref>

=== Holy texts ===

[[File:Keren GOF.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Keren Rhinn]], [[paladin]] of Iomedae and [[Knight of Ozem]].]]

{{Main|Acts of Iomedae}}

Her holy text is called the ''[[Acts of Iomedae]]'',<ref name="GM-21">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|21}}</ref> or more often just the ''The Acts'', and recounts the 11 miracles she performed during her mortal life.<ref name="ISWG-222"/>

=== Holy sites ===

One of Iomedae's best known and most important temples is the [[Seventh Church]] in Absalom, site of her seventh miracle (''see Acts of Iomedae above'').<ref name="ISWG-39">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|39}}</ref>

=== Holidays ===

The 6th of [[Lamashan]] is [[Ascendance Day]], commemorating the day Iomedae took the Test of the Starstone and achieved godhood.<ref>{{Cite book/Campaign Setting|238}}</ref> [[Inheritor's Ascendance]] is celebrated on the first of [[Arodus]] every year to mark the day when the goddess became the herald of Aroden.<ref name="GM-21">{{Cite book/Gods & Magic|21}}</ref> On the 19th of [[Rova]] is the [[Day of the Inheritor]], which marks the entrance of Aroden's faithful into the church of Iomedae. Iomedae's Church has a number of other festivals including [[First Crusader Day]] on 6th Arodus, [[Armasse]] on 16th Arodus, and [[Remembrance Moon]] on the day of the full moon in [[Desnus]].<ref>{{Cite book/Faiths of Purity|31}}</ref>

=== Favored animals ===

Gods are often associated with certain [[animal]]s, either because they possess a quality favored by the god, or because the god's faithful feel a special kinship to them. Iomedae's favored animals include [[lion]]s, [[eagle]]s and other symbols of leadership, and [[bird|migratory birds]].<ref name="AA-ibc">{{Cite book/Animal Archive|inside back cover}}</ref>

== Organizations ==

The most famous of the military orders devoted to spreading Iomedae's word is the Knights of Ozem, in whose ranks Iomedae herself served when she was mortal.<ref>{{Cite book/Faiths of Purity|23}}</ref>

The [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] [[Order of the Godclaw]] worships an aspect of Iomedae, although they are not part of the church.<ref name="ISWG-266">{{Cite book/The Inner Sea World Guide|266}}</ref>
