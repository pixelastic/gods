  "description": "A relatively new faith, Urazra seems to have only existed a few hundred years (less than a lifespan to its stone giant worshipers). It is proving popular with younger stone giants. Urazra is a savage deity promising his followers greater strength, fortitude and even complete immunity to pain in exchange for acts of brutal savagery and sacrifices of still bloody raw flesh.",
